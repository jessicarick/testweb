<p>I would not be where I am today without a multitude of people helping me out— both in terms of teaching me skills and sharing resources. For this reason, I like to pay it forward and help others out as they learn and go about their research. On this page, I have a random smattering of resources related to various different research that I’ve done, including some explainers, some tutorials, and some things just for fun. Please feel free to use these resources or pass them along to others— and please do let me know if they are useful to you, or if have suggestions for making them more so!</p>
<p>More resources can be found on my GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/jessicarick/resources">https://github.com/jessicarick/resources</a>.</p>
