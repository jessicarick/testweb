# UHURU Small Mammal Genetics

Through a combination of diet diversity analysis, abundance and occupancy estimates, and genetic estimates of population structure, we are working to test hypotheses from Hanski and Brown about rarity. Briefly, Hanski ([1985](https://doi.org/10.2307/1940383)) postulates that common/widespread species are common because they are good dispersers, and can therefore rescue populations after they are extirpated. Brown ([1984](https://doi.org/10.1086/284267)), on the other hand, hypothesizes that common/widespread species are common because they are resource generalists, and such generalization promotes high in-situ reproduction. We are testing these differing hypotheses using data from five species co-existing at Mpala Research Centre, Kenya ([https://mpala.org/](https://mpala.org/)): *Taterillus harringtoni, Gerbilliscus robustus, Aethomys hindei, Saccostomus mearnsi, Elephantulus rufescens*.

## Goals for the genetics portion

We are using the genetic data to produce an estimate of connectivity and migration rates between populations, as a metric of dispersal in each of the species.
